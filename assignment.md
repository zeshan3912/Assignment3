# Assignment CMPUT811

## Goal

To explore deep learning via hands on exercise. To try out deep
learning on a new dataset.

## Overview

* you will pose a deep learning solution for another problem
* you will import or generate data for that problem
* you will try 3 different deep learning architectures on your problem
* you will write a short report about your endeavour.
* you will commit both the report and the source code to a git
  repository
* you will host that repository on github
* you will share with the instructor the URI of that github repo
  e.g. https://github.com/abramhindle/theanets-tutorial

## Deliverables

* 1 Github Repo URI that contains within it
  * 1 derivative program that imports your data set
    and sets up a deep learning network to
    train, validate, and test on your dataset.
    * your program will explore 3 different architectures
      * each architecture should differ in the number of layers
        and in the number of neurons
  * 1 sample dataset if it is less than 100mb
    * or the script to generate it
  * 1 PDF or Markdown Report
    * 1 description of your data set
      * include source code if you generate it
      * instructions how to get the dataset or generate it
    * 1 description of your problem
    * 1 description of you condition your inputs
    * 1 description of your interpret your outputs
    * 1 description of performance of each architecture on the deep
      learning task. Describe accuracy and TP, TN, FP, FN.
    * 1 discussion whereby you suggest possible ways of improving the result
    * 1 summary

## Rubric

10 marks:

* 20% Dataset generation / import
* 50% Project Report
* 30% Program

Each component is rated as Unsatisfactory, Poor, Satisfactory, Good,
Excellent.


## Clarifications

* If you have more than 4 pages then you're probably writing way too
  much.

* I expect about 1-2 pages.

* You can modify my data-generators. But it has to be distinct and
  different.

* You are free to use other source code as long as the licenses are
  compatible and you have permission and you can cite it.

* The deliverable will be in a github repo

* The only text you submit will be the url to your github repository

* You github repo will contain your source code and report

* You may fork the theanets-tutorial from
  https://github.com/abramhindle/theanets-tutorial

* You will cite all sources -- for code and for writing.
